## Orthography &c. notes

[there is a pic with notes in the folder & a lot of this is based on talking with Ramsey on Wednesday]

### Main Principles
* Special characters are annoying, esp. things like -> => :: and we don’t need em

* Undecided on significant whitespace … leaning to no

* Highlighting the functional approach that already exists things like js chaining and .map() type functions is good, but keeping common js/json approaches, like the use of : to separate indicator and value is also good

* Getting people out of parsing stage and into functions in js where we do the routing for output is key [via Ramsey]. 

* Aim will be to compile a data-monster file into js, similar to the way CoffeeScript works. Users can then adjust it further. We do not seek to be a complete solution. (At least not at first.)
