# Contributing to Data Monster

If you want to contribute to Data Monster in its current state you are both a hero and someone who maybe ought to have her mind checked out. But hey! Welcome!

Mostly, I just ask for the same best practices any open source project would have: write in a style consistent with the current code, let me know before starting on a huge change, even just opening issues helps me know where to direct my attention.

If you have general stylistic feedback or concerns, you can also email me at: [hi@sarahgp.com](mailto:hi@sarahgp.com).

### Basic Structure

### Want to help but not ready to dive into the code?
One thing I could really use help with is trying to translate current d3 examples — particularly [Basic Charts](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery#basic-charts) — into Data Monster and then either adding these to the examples repo or opening issues on the (inevitable) bugs.
